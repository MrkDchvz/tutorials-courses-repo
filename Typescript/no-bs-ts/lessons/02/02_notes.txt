=== Keypoints of the lesson ===
+ ts-node 
    - is an exeuction engine for node (node can't run typescript by default).
    
+ Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT) 
    - compilation of code on run time/exeuction. Instead of compiling it first then executing the code.

+ Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) 
    -  Interactive programming environment that allows programming directly on the terminal.

+ Typescript does type checks on compile time and not on runtime.

+ npx tsc <file name> 
    - compile ts file to javascript file

+ Optional Chaining Operator(?) 
    - is used to return undefined when an object/property doesn't exists instead of throwing an error

+ REST parameter (...) 
   - if used in function params it allows to dynamically create n times parameters without specifying each one of them
