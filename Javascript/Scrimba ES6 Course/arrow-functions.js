// Arrow functions
// - Has an implicit return when its not wrapped with curly braces {}
// - no need parenthesis if there is one parameter (But i'll add it anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
const dinnerMenu = (food) => `I'm going to eat a ${food} for dinner`;

// Equivalent to:
/* function dinnerMenu(food) {
    return `I'm going to eat a ${food} for dinner`
}
*/
